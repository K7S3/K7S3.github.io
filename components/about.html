                <p>ðŸš€ Hi, I'm Keshavan â€” a builder, researcher, and entrepreneur at heart.</p>
                <p>I'm currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Prudential Financial, where I focus on building ML platforms and generative AI solutions to drive innovation in financial and insurance services. My work spans LLM-powered agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ML frameworks, and AI infrastructure â€” helping teams deploy AI products that are scalable, secure, and business-ready.</p>
                <p>Before Prudential, I founded two startups: Synergii, an AI-driven platform that helps entrepreneurs and SMBs find funding opportunities â€” from grants to venture capital, and another venture focused on AI solutions. I took Synergii from zero to a live product, running semantic search, RAG pipelines, and full-stack development end-to-end whilst deploying on AWS.</p>
                <p>I hold a Master's in Computer Science from Cornell Tech, and dual degrees (Bachelor's + Master's) from IIIT Hyderabad. My research background includes computational biology (GPCR activation mechanisms, molecular dynamics), molecular ML models for drug discovery, and contributions to open-source projects like 3Dmol.js through Google Summer of Code. I've published in the Journal of Chemical Education and presented research on allosteric communication in proteins.</p>
                <p>My interests lie at the intersection of AI research and product-building, especially in LLMs, agents, autonomous systems, and AI for finance. I'm passionate about building AI agents that can understand, reason, and act in complex environments.</p>
                <p>ðŸ’¡ If you're working on cutting-edge AI, fintech, or want to chat about startup ideas, feel free to connect!</p>
